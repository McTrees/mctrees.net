                                        <h3>McTrees first founded</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            McTrees was first founded by Robbie in 2014. Our server was run on an old overworked laptop. We had no registered domain and no proper network infrastructure. It was literally a laptop running the windows 'minecraft server'. Over the years, more joined the McTrees cause and we now have 4 admins, Robbie, Ben, Calvin and Oliver.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>First steps (into DNS)</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Later the next year, in september , we registered for a free DDNS account. With that we got our first ‘domain’: http://mctrees.ddns.net/ . early the next year we began hosting our first website. Its design can be found here in the McTrees archive . This site was still being hosted on an overworked laptop with WAMP (a free piece of software) as the web server.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Games & Multimedia Environments BSc (Hons)</h3>
                                        <p>At the start of 2016 we registered our first ‘proper’ domain, mctrees.net. With that came updates to our hosting and networking. At this point we were running the site with an old desktop, that was certainly better suited to the task.

                                        <p>This is a small startup that a friend and I created to gain more skills and apply those I had learned while completing my diploma. Since its inception, as a front - end web developer I have advised, designed and built web solutions for numerous clients.
