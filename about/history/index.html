                <h1>History</h1>
                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">"I just got bored one sunday afternoon" - Robbie</h5>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">McTrees was first founded by Robbie in 2014. Our server was run on an old overworked laptop. We had no registered domain and no proper network infrastructure. It was literally a laptop running the windows 'minecraft server'. Over the years, more joined the McTrees cause and we now have 4 admins, Robbie, Ben, Calvin and Oliver.</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey">Later the next year, in september , we registered for a free DDNS account. With that we got our first ‘domain’: http://mctrees.ddns.net/ . early the next year we began hosting our first website. Its design can be found <a href="http://archive.mctrees.net/2015">here</a> in the <a href="http://archive.mctrees.net/">McTrees archive </a>. This site was still being hosted on an overworked laptop with WAMP (a free piece of software) as the web server.</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey"> At the start of 2016 we registered our first ‘proper’ domain, <a href="http://mctrees.net"> mctrees.net</a>. With that came updates to our hosting and networking. At this point we were running the site with an old desktop, that was certainly better suited to the task.</p>
                <p class="w3-text-grey"> A few months later we redesigned the website. This design stuck, with a few minor alterations, for over a year. Unfortunately, you cannot find this in the McTrees Archive, as it was destroyed during the transition to the new site.<!--This design can be found at <a href="http://archive.mctrees.net/2016">here</a>--></p>

                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Fast forward a year and a half and McTrees is now being run in a visualized install of Linux, with Debian and apache.</h5>
                <p class="w3-text-grey"> We have load balancing and redundancy as well as a plethora of security and backup features. In april 2017 we finally overhauled the main design of website to be compliant with google's material design language as well as a lot more intuitive to the end-user. The new design features better mobile support and is more resource efficient. You are viewing the current design right now.</p>
